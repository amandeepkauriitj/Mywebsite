I am an Assistant Professor in the department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur. My research is focussed on analog and mixed signal integrated circuit design which is generic as well as application specific like CMOS image sensors and biomedical circuits and systems.

I received my doctoral degree in the department of Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, 2019. During my Ph.D., I have designed and characterized various integrated circuits like comparators, LDO, single stage ADC, two stage ADC, hybrid ADC, and two complete camera systems for high speed and low power applications. The work is published in elite transactions and conferences.

If anyone is interested in the area of analog and mixed signal VLSI design, then feel free to contact me.
